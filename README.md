*#Interactive Wheel of Life: A Self-Monitoring Tool*

**Brief Details of the Project:**

The wheel of life is a visual tool to understand how balanced or full filled our work-life is at this moment. Interactive wheel of life is a web interface ([workbalancedlife.web.app](https://workbalancedlife.web.app/)) which helps the user to asses and monitor various areas of life like business life, creative life, social life, love life and life purpose in real-time. These mentioned areas cover sub-areas [1] like money and finance, career and work, health and fitness, fun and recreation, environment, community, family and friends, partners and love, growth and learning and spirituality. Initially the user needs to rate these all sub-areas in Likert scale (1-10). Input values can be visualized using the wheel of life and also helps to correlate the same with predefined balanced life and unbalance life measures.

Second part of the interface provides an option to adjust (tune) the earlier Liker values and helps to compare the same with the current state of work-life balance. The main objective is to adjust the sub-areas which will help the user to move towards a more balanced life. Users will be able to understand in which sub-area he/she needs to improve or tone down to make work-life more balanced.

**Conclusion:**

There is always a need to improve overall work performance, lower the stress level, increase the job and life satisfaction and decrease family conflicts in our everyday life. This online interface helps to identify in which life area/sub-area needs to be prioritized and how much to prioritize. A continuous monitoring through this interface will surely increase peace of mind and help to live life happily.
